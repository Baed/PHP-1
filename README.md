    Go to a website
    go to internet and directs to 3 servers (web, app, and database)
    go to web server (apache, NGNIX, etc. & html/css/javascript/angularJS/ReactJS/jquery)
    go to app server (python, java, ruby, node) renders page in html/css/javascript
    go to database server (oracle, mysql)
    LAMP stack (linux, apache, mysql, php), MAMP, WAMP (Mac or windows) for example 
    front end handles web server primarilly
    back end handles app and database servers
    middle tier handles app server
    full stack covers all 3 servers (web, app, database)
    MVC (model - database, view - web, controller - app)
    SPA (single page application)
    web server uses port and host numbers, 127.0.0.1 is local host, port is 8888, so http://localhost:8888/
